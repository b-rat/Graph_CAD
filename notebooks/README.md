# Notebooks

Jupyter notebooks for experimentation, visualization, and analysis.

## Suggested Organization

- `01_data_exploration.ipynb` - Explore CAD datasets and graph structures
- `02_model_development.ipynb` - Prototype and test model architectures
- `03_training_experiments.ipynb` - Training runs and hyperparameter tuning
- `04_results_visualization.ipynb` - Visualize results and generated CAD models

## Best Practices

- Keep notebooks focused on exploration and visualization
- Move production code to the `graph_cad/` package
- Include clear markdown explanations of experiments
- Save important visualizations to `docs/figures/`
